# Astrotool

A Python3 console-based exoplanet detection tool.

## Motivation
This program was made by me during the CSUDH MSEIP, for use on the Physics team. We were tasked with using/manipulating the recorded light curves from stars during planetary transits, as well as determining their radii using the transited star's radius (given) and the dip in the light level, which is automatically calculated by the tool.

## Dependencies
pip install lightkurve

## How to Use
The program is launched using astrotool.py, located in the main directory.
There are many variables and "flags" which can be adjusted, enabled, and disabled in vars.py. This includes enabling/disabling sound effects, file saving, cadence masking, desired telescope, desired cadence, periodogram default bounds, and more.
